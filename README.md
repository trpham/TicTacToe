### Tic-Tac-Toe Strategy

- Always try to go first, and start by playing one of the 4 corners or the center square.

- If the other player goes first and chooses one of the corners, choose the center square. If they choose the center square, choose one of the corners.

- After that, do whatever you think is best to win.
